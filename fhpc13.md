<h4>Background</h4>
<p>
The FHPC workshop aims at bringing together researchers exploring uses
of functional (or more generally, declarative or high-level) programming
technology in application domains where large-scale computations arise
naturally and high performance is essential. Such computations would
typically -- but not necessarily -- involve execution on highly parallel
systems ranging from multi-core multi-processor systems to graphics
accelerators (GPGPUs), reconfigurable hardware (FPGAs), large-scale
compute clusters or any combination thereof. It is becoming apparent
that radically new and well founded methodologies for programming such
systems are required to address their inherent complexity and to
reconcile execution performance with programming productivity.
</p>

<p>The aim of the meeting is to enable sharing of results, experiences, 
and novel ideas about how high-level, declarative specifications of 
computationally challenging problems can serve as highly transparent, 
maintainable, and portable code that approaches (or even exceeds) the 
performance of machine-oriented imperative implementations.</p>

<p>
Each FHPC workshop proposes a particular theme for applications where 
high-performance computing and/or functional programming technology
can be applied. For FHPC 2013, the theme is "Large-Scale Simulation",
traditionally one of the main driving forces behind supercomputing.
A large fraction of compute cycles in supercomputers worldwide is spent
on simulation tasks, for various engineering tasks, drug design and
other medical simulations, and in different natural science domains.
Declarative languages have potential to radically change development
practice and workflow for simulation software in these areas.
Hence, we particularly encourage submission of application-oriented
contributions in the area of simulation. 
<br/>
As a general rule, while proposing the theme, the workshop welcomes
submissions from all relevant application domains as well as those
describing general work on the theory and practice of declarative
high-performance computing.</p>

<p>
FHPC 2013 is the second workshop in the FHPC series.

The first workshop was run in 2012</a>, affiliated with ICFP in Copenhagen.

<h4>Submission and publication</h4>

<p>
Contributions should be submitted via Easychair.
Submitted papers must be in portable document format (PDF), formatted
according to the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines (double column, 9pt format).

adhere to ACM SIGPLAN's <a href="http://www.sigplan.org/republicationpolicy.htm">republication policy</a>. Submission deadlines and 
page limit are firm. </p>

<p>Accepted papers will be published by the ACM and will appear in the 
ACM Digital Library.</p>

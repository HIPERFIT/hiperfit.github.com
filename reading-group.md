## Description

This page documents the activities of the HIPERFIT reading group,
which was initiated in April 2015. We meet on tuesdays from 13:00 to
15:00 (approx.) following the schedule below. The schedule will be
updated continuously.

### Time usage

The reading group will run for 23 times, with an expected time usage
around 8 hours for each session (including preparation), which will
total 184 hours, which should correspond to 7.5 ECTS.

### Topics
We will be reading papers in several topics in the core area of
HIPERFIT, namely functional programming languages for financial IT.

 * Programming language design for parallel programming
 * Type systems for array based languages (e.g. dependent types)
 * high-performance computing optimizations and algorithms.
 * Automatic/algorithmic differentiation
 * Finance and monte-carlo simulation

### Participants
 * Troels Henriksen (Ph.D. student)
 * Danil Annenkov (Ph.D. student)
 * Frederik Meisner Madsen (Ph.D. student)
 * Martin Dybdal (Ph.D. student)
 * Andrzej Filinski (Supervisor)
 * Martin Elsman (Supervisor)
 * Cosmin Oancea (Supervisor)

Other HIPERFIT faculty and students are welcome to participate in the
meetings on voluntary basis.

This page documents the activities of the HIPERFIT reading group,
which was initiated in April 2015. All HIPERFIT faculty and students
are welcome to participate in the meetings. We meet on tuesdays from
13:00 to 15:00, with the schedule listed below (will updated continuously).

For Ph.D. students applying for ECTS-credit, attendance is mandatory.

The reading group will run for 23 times, with an expected time usage
around 8 hours for each session (including preparation), which will
total 184 hours, which should correspond to 7.5 ECTS.

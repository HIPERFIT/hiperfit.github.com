### Bachelor Projects

### Project: Parallel Optimisation Methods for Futhark

This project aims at developing one or more numerical optimisation
methods for [Futhark](https://futhark-lang.org) and at investigating
the possibilities for parallelising the methods and contexts in which
optimisation occurs. In general, when _f : R^n -> R_ is a
high-dimensional function, finding the argument tuple that maximises
(or minimises) the function is considered an optimisation
problem. Depending on the properties of _f_ (e.g., convexity) and
whether it is feasible to compute the derivative of _f_ (with respect
to some location and some direction), different methods apply.

A project may involve identifying a real-world problem to solve (using
an optimisation method), for instance within economics or engineering,
and it will involve getting acquainted with using the
data-parallel programming language
[Futhark](https://futhark-lang.org), which makes it possible to run
data-parallel applications efficiently on GPUs.

Possible optimisation routines worth considering include routines such
as Nelder Mead and gradient descent.

### Project: Solving Coupled Differential Equations in Futhark

Using [Futhark](https://futhark-lang.org)'s higher-order
parameterisation methods (e.g., higher-order functions and modules),
this project aims at developing generic routines for solving sets of
coupled differential equations in parallel (over sets of different
parameter sets).

Methods of interest include Euler's method, Heun's method, and other,
more involved, Runge-Kuta methods.

A project may involve identifying a real-world problem to solve, for
instance within economics or engineering, and it will involve getting
acquainted with using the data-parallel programming language
[Futhark](https://futhark-lang.org), which makes it possible to run
data-parallel applications efficiently on GPUs.

### Project: Data-Parallel Interpretation of Numerical Code

Sometimes, it is beneficial to run in parallel (e.g., on a GPU) code
that is represented as input data (e.g., instructions for a stack
machine, perhaps generated by a Python program).

Using [Futhark](https://futhark-lang.org)'s support for simple
algebraic (non-recursive) datatypes, this project aims at
investigating the possibility for parallel execution of sequences of
stack machine instructions and to investigate possible uses of the
technique.

Possible use cases include analysis of fractal images and [recurrent equations](https://github.com/melsman/feigenbaum).

A project may involve identifying a real-world problem to solve, for
instance within economics or engineering, and it will involve getting
acquainted with using the data-parallel programming language

data-parallel applications efficiently on GPUs.

### Project: Memory-Region Aware Task-Parallel Programming in Standard ML

This project aims at investigating the use of MLKit (a Standard ML
compiler that uses region-inference as the primary memory management
strategy) for implementing a set of task-parallel algorithms.

Combining a memory discipline such as region-inference with routines
for task-parallelism can be beneficial due to guarantees given by the
memory discipline that data-races cannot appear.  The MLKit compiler,
developed at DIKU, has recently been augmented with preliminary
support for writing task-parallel programs. This project aims at
experimenting with and evaluating this compiler extension and
perhaps compare its performance with the [MPL](https://github.com/MPLLang/mpl)
compiler, a derivative of MLton.

A project may involve identifying a real-world problem to solve, for
instance within economics or engineering, and it will involve getting
acquainted with writing programs in Standard ML (much similar to
writing F# or OCaml code).

### Project: The HIPERFIT Portfolio Management Prototype

Please consult [the project background information](/pdf/HIPERFIT_PROTOTYPE_2016_ADDITIONAL_INFORMATION.pdf) and the [bachelor project teaser slides](/pdf/HIPERFIT_PROTOTYPE_2016.pdf).

### Project: Optimization of a Haskell Automatic Differentiation Library

Esben Halvorsen describes in his MSc project [Calculating Key Ratios
for Financial Products using Automatic Differentiation and Monte Carlo
Simulation](/pdf/ad_esben.pdf), how to construct a
Haskell framework for Automatic Differention (AD), which turns out to
be useful for calculating "the greeks" (key ratios) for financial
products. The framework has been implemented in Haskell and the
project report outlines a series of possibilities for optimizations,
including an improved representation of arrays. This project is about
investigating the possibilities for optimization of the AD framework,
possibly for pricing and calculating greeks on parallel hardware.

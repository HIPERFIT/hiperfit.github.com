This page lists a series of suggested student projects within HIPERFIT. For more information about the possibilities, please talk to the appropriate contact persons.

* Project: [Haskell Library for Finance](studentproject_haskell_library_finance.html).

This project is about constructing a modular library in Haskell for
pricing financial contracts and portfolios â€“ either solely based on
so-called closed-form functions or also coupled with Monte Carlo
simulations. The main focus is to work on code structure and code
architecture to reach a proof-of-concept level. 

'''Contact person:''' Jost Berthold (joint supervision with Sinan Gabel).

* Project: [Parallel Monte Carlo Simulations in Haskell](studentproject_haskell_montecarlo.html).

This project is about constructing a Monte Carlo simulation library in
Haskell. The library should be structured to allow for different
statistical distributions (e.g. the Gaussian normal and log-normal) and
for parallel execution. Consideration should be given to parallel
calculations such that each thread generates random numbers that are
independent from the other threads' calculations. The generator should
be deterministic if given the same initialisation i.e. given the same
so-called seed value - in other words given a certain seed value the
generator simulates the same pseudo-random numbers.

Today, the financial sector faces daunting computational challenges,
involving both an increased demand for performance and increased
transparency requirements. In addition, time-to-market is increasingly
important for financial applications, both by commercial software
developers and in-house.

Funded by the Danish Council for Strategic Research, the research
center HIPERFIT was founded in 2010 to address these issues. The name
HIPERFIT stands for Functional high-performance computing for
financial information technology. The center started as a joint effort
of researchers and selected founding partners from the financial
industry. It is open for new collaborators from industry and
commerce.

Research in HIPERFIT attempts to solve the simultaneous challenges of
high transparency, high computational performance and high
productivity in an integrated approach of declarative domain specific
and high-level functional programming languages. The center gathers
research in different communities: mathematical finance, programming
languages and high-performance systems, and application experts from
the financial sector contribute cutting edge knowledge from their
respective fields, to bear on problems transcending their own field of
expertise.

HIPERFIT stands for research in tailor-made expressive programming
languages, frameworks, tools and technologies for financial modeling,
and effective use of modern parallel hardware without compromising
correctness, transparency or portability.

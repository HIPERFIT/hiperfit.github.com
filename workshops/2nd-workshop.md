## Mathematical Finance meets Programming Languages and Systems

### 2nd HIPERFIT Workshop: December 1st and 2nd

Hiperfit joins researchers from the departments of Computer Science,
Mathematics, and Physics, and major industrial partners. Researchers
and practicioners contribute cutting edge knowledge from their
respective fields to bear on computational and algorithmic problems
that transcend their own field of expertise. In view of our
interdisciplinary spirit, HIPERFIT organises biannual workshops to
encourage experts' exchange and discussions.

In our 2nd workshop, which will take place in Copenhagen on December
1-2, we have invited members of our advisory board and other guests,
gathering 10 invited presentations and two special talks (DIKU talk
and COPLAS talk series). Our speakers are international researchers
from the different HIPERFIT areas, ranging from from modern
mathematical finance, via programming language technology and modern
approaches to parallel programming, to high-performance
systems.

The workshop is open to public, interested researchers and
practicioners of all related fields are invited to participate in this
exciting event in Copenhagen, to meet and discuss with our
international speakers and guests. Download the [call for
participation as pdf](../pdf/CallForParticipation12-2011.pdf) / [as
text](../pdf/CallForParticipation12-2011.txt).

There will be no published proceedings, the meeting is intended to be
an interdisciplinary forum for discussion and
networking. Participation is free of charge, but for organisational
purposes, a workshop registration is required. **Workshop registration
online is closed now**.

Links to all slides from the workshop can now be found on the
[abstracts page](abstracts.html).

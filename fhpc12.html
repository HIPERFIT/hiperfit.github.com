<h2 class="c">ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on<br/>
<i>Functional High-Performance Computing</i>, FHPC'12
</h2>


<h3 class="c">Copenhagen, Denmark <br/>
15 September 2012<br/><br/>
Co-located with the<br/> <a href="http://icfpconference.org/icfp2012/"><i>
17th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming</i></a> (ICFP 2012)
</h3>

<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The FHPC workshop aims at bringing together researchers exploring uses 
of functional (or more generally, declarative or high-level) programming 
technology in application domains where large-scale computations arise
naturally and high performance is essential. Such computations would 
typically -- but not necessarily -- involve execution on highly parallel
systems ranging from multi-core multi-processor systems to graphics
accelerators (GPGPUs), reconfigurable hardware (FPGAs), large-scale 
compute clusters or any combination thereof. It is becoming apparent 
that radically new and well founded methodologies for programming such 
systems are required to address their inherent complexity and to 
reconcile execution performance with programming productivity.</p>

<p>The aim of the meeting is to enable sharing of results, experiences, 
and novel ideas about how high-level, declarative specifications of 
computationally challenging problems can serve as highly transparent, 
maintainable, and portable code that approaches (or even exceeds) the 
performance of machine-oriented imperative implementations.</p>

<p>The 2012 FHPC workshop comes with a particular theme motivated by
geographic co-location with the newly
established <a href="http://hiperfit.dk/"><i>HIPERFIT Research Centre
for Functional High-Performance Computing for Financial Information
Technology</i></a> at the University of Copenhagen. Hence, we
particularly encourage submissions with a background in computational
finance. Notwithstanding, the workshop welcomes submissions from other
application domains as much as general-purpose work on the theory and
practice of declarative approaches to high-performance computing.</p>

<h4>Submission and publication</h4>

<p> Submitted papers must be in portable document format (PDF), formatted
according to the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines (double column, 9pt format).
See the <a href="http://www.sigplan.org/authorInformation.htm">SIGPLAN Author Information page</a> for more information and style files. The page limit is 12 pages. Any paper submitted must 
adhere to ACM SIGPLAN's <a href="http://www.sigplan.org/republicationpolicy.htm">republication policy</a>. Submission deadlines and 
page limit are firm. </p>

<p>Accepted papers will be published by the ACM and will appear in the 
ACM Digital Library.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fhpc2012">submission site</a> is now open!</p>

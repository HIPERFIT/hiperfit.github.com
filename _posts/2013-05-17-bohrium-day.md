== Backgound ==

[Bohrium](http://bohrium.bitbucket.org/) is a "Plug-and-play"
high-performance backend targeting CPU clusters and other parallel
architectures, such as GPGPUs. The goal of the Bohrium project is to
provide a runtime environment for efficiently executing vectorized
applications using a variety of programming languages (Python/NumPy,
C#, F#) on a variety of platforms (Linux, Windows and MacOSX).

By collecting bytecode instructions at runtime and by generating (and
caching) efficient GPU kernels, programmers may utilize end-user's
clusters of GPUs and multi-core CPUs without having to program these
new architectures explicitly.

The Bohrium project is a part of the HIPERFIT research center.

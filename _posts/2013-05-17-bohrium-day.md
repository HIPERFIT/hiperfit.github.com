On Friday May 24, 2013, Brian Vinter's group at the Niels Bohr Institute is
arranging a Bohrium workshop called the "Bohrium Day". 

**Place:** at NBI - see [Bohrium Day venue information](pdf/BohriumDay2013-venue.pdf).

**Registration:** Please send an email to "vinter at nbi.dk".

## Program

See [the detailed program](pdf/BohriumDay2013-program.pdf).

## Backgound

[Bohrium](http://bohrium.bitbucket.org/) is a "Plug-and-play"
high-performance backend targeting CPU clusters and other parallel
architectures, such as GPGPUs. The goal of the Bohrium project is to
provide a runtime environment for efficiently executing vectorized
applications using a variety of programming languages (Python/NumPy,
C#, F#) on a variety of platforms (Linux, Windows and MacOSX).

By collecting bytecode instructions at runtime and by generating (and
caching) efficient GPU kernels, programmers may utilize end-user's
clusters of GPUs and multi-core CPUs without having to program these
new architectures explicitly.

The Bohrium project is a part of the HIPERFIT research center.

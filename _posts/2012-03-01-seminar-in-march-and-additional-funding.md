Please find here a quick update and invitation to our HIPERFIT seminar in March, next Tuesday.

The seminar will be held on Tuesday, March 6, 3pm in MÃ¸delokale A/B at DIKU.

This month, the seminar is dedicated to our additional [SME
funding](index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=34).

HIPERFIT's funding agency, the Danish Council for Strategic Research
(DSF), provides additional funds to existing big research projects,
with the goal to expand ongoing research to small and medium
enterprises (SMEs).

The focus of the cooperation with HIPERFIT is parallel quantitative
analysis of financial instruments, especially pricing and risk
analysis. In particular, we want to accelerate such computations
through using highly-parallel graphics processing units (GPGPUs).

Knowledge and software within financial computation will be
contributed by SMEs -- cooperation focuses on parallelisation, and to
a lesser extent on the mathematical methods used.

In the seminar, Professor Rolf Poulsen will introduce the topic in more detail,
and present and discuss suggested SME-collabration projects we
received in response to the call:

- **FinE Analytics:** Pricing Danish mortgage bonds in scenario trees in a _parallel
  cloud environment using functional programming in Dyalog APL_.

- **Bangert Research:** Post-crisis yield curve estimation and risk
  management using parallel architectures

Interested parties and HIPERFIT partners are especially welcome.

Best regards from HIPERFIT

## Abstract:

When estimated volatilities are not in perfect agreement with reality,
delta hedged option portfolios will incur a non-zero profit-and-loss
over time. There is, however, a surprisingly simple formula for the
resulting hedge error, which has been known since the late 90s. We
call this The Fundamental Theorem of Derivative Trading. This paper is
a survey with twists of that result. We prove a more general version
of it and discuss various extensions (including jumps) and
applications (including deriving the Dupire-Gyöngy-Derman/Kani
formula). We also consider its practical consequences both in
simulation experiments and on empirical data thus demonstrating the
benefits of hedging with implied volatility. The paper is available
[online](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2566425).

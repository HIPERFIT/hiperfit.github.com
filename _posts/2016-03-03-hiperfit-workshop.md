### 2016 HIPERFIT Workshop for Partners and Faculty

On March 3, 2016, HIPERFIT is hosting a workshop for HIPERFIT
HIPERFIT [partners](/partners.html) and [faculty](/people.html). At the workshop, HIPERFIT faculty, including PhD
students, will present the latest developments in the various HIPERFIT
project. A
separate session is devoted to partners for presenting opportunities for involving HIPERFIT
researchers in obstacles encountered by the partners with respect to
high-performance computational problems in the finance domain.

The year 2016 is formally the last HIPERFIT year and much has happened
since the HIPERFIT launch in 2011. We are therefore also happy to
demonstrate our more long term findings and how we envision that the
HIPERFIT work can continue to make a difference in the years to come.

### Abstracts for Talks on March 3, 2016

#### 09:00-10:15 &nbsp; Compiling for Parallel Computations

_<a name="meisner"></a>__Streaming Nested Data Parallelism__ (Frederik Meisner Madsen)_

This talk presents ongoing work on a streaming dataflow model for
nested data parallelism. By evaluating bulk operations in chunks in a
network of stream transformers, the streaming model saves
significantly more space than traditional data-parallel languages in
many common cases. On GPUs, the device memory is very limited relative to
the available parallelism, making streaming essential in large
computations. On CPUs, streaming can help improve cache performance,
and since fusion is not as essential on CPUs as on GPUs, the streaming
model can leverage pre-compiled kernels that are hand-optimized with
SIMD instructions and multi-threading.

_<a name="dybdal"></a>__A low-level functional GPU language__ (Martin Dybdal)_

Obsidian is an embedded functional language that allows playfulness
and experimentation when developing data-parallel algorithms for GPUs.
Obsidian gives explicit control of shared-memory usage, fusion,
loop-unrolling, warp-level computations etc., when developing new GPU
algorithms. This feature makes it possible to generate high
performance GPU-kernels, in a simpler framework than plain
CUDA/OpenCL.

In this presentation, we show how to "unembed" Obsidian to create a
standalone language FCL, a language at the same level as Obsidian, but
designed as an intermediate language. Our plan is to use FCL as an
intermediate language for our APL-compiler, and to allow users to
inline FCL-terms, when performance tuning is necessary.

_<a name="annenkov"></a>__Verifying the generation of payoff-language expressions__ (Danil Annnenkov)_

In this presentation, we present some results on pushing forward code
certification in connection with the HIPERFIT Portfolio Management
Prototype project. The contract DSL, which is used to express a large
variety of financial contracts, is translated into an intermediate
language (IL) inspired by traditional approaches to payoff
languages. The IL is mapped relatively straightforwardly to a subset
of language constructs in other languages, such as OpenCL, Haskell,
and Futhark. The generated code is then "fused" into an appropriate
contract valuation engine. Translation from the contract DSL to the IL
is proven correct with respect to a language semantics specified in
the Coq proof assistant. The extracted translation code works nicely
with the certified code for contract analysis and transformation.

#### 10:30-11:30 &nbsp; The Futhark Parallel Optimizing Compiler

_<a name="henriksen"></a>__Introduction to the Futhark language and compiler__ (Troels Henriksen, DIKU)_

Compiling real-world applications to efficient parallel code,
especially when targeting vector hardware such as GPUs, requires an
optimiser and code generator that can exploit a combination of
high-level invariants and low-level optimisations.  We present a
purely functional data-parallel programming language, named Futhark,
that supports nested map-reduce parallelism on regular arrays, but
also a set of "imperative" constructs, such as in-place updates and
do-loops.  We report in-progress work on our optimising Futhark
compiler, and demonstrate significant speedups for a range of
benchmark programs.

_<a name="serup"></a>__Experiences porting Accelerate code to Futhark__ (Niels Gustav Westphal Serup, DIKU)_

The people working on the embedded array language Accelerate have a
repository of computation-heavy benchmarks.  In this talk I present
how I have ported some of their benchmarks to Futhark.  I then
describe how I have creatively measured the correctness of the Futhark
code, which can be challenging due to several technical factors.
Finally I compare and discuss the execution time of hand-written
Futhark code and hand-written Accelerate code.

#### 11:45-13:00 &nbsp; Bohrium

_<a name="skovhede"></a>__SME and BPU: High-level development for low-level hardware__ (Kenneth Skovhede, NBI)_

In this talk I present the motivation and ideas behind the FPGA
backend for the Bohrium Runtime System. I start by covering the
evolution and experiments we performed with Synchronous Message
Exchange (SME) as a design pattern for developing hardware. I then
describe how we use the SME model and our VHDL generation system to
rapidly prototype hardware. Finally I show the current state of the
BPU and show how the processor maps to FPGA hardware.

_<a name="kristensen"></a>__Fusion of Parallel Array Operations__ (Mads Kristensen, NBI)_

Array operation fusion is a program transformation that combines, or
fuses, multiple array operations into a kernel of operations. When it
is applicable, the technique can drastically improve cache utilization
through temporal data locality and enables other program
transformations such as streaming and array contraction. Thus, the
challenge is to find which array operations to fuse in order to
maximize memory access reuse.

The traditional formulation of this problem is as a graph partitioning
problem. Given a DAG that represents array operation dependencies and
is extended with undirected weight edges and fuse-preventing edges,
find a partition that minimizes the sum of the weight edges that cuts
between partition blocks while nodes connected with fuse-preventing
edges are not in the same partition block. This graph problem is known
as that Weighted Loop Fusion Problem. In my talk, I will show that
this formulation is insufficient when optimizing for memory access
reuse and introduce a new graph formulation that is sufficient.

_<a name="vinter"></a>__BDAE – Big Data Analysis Engine__ (Brian Vinter, NBI)_

In Big Data Analytics the primary processing approach is MapReduce,
which based on a physical distribution of the data so that processing
is done in parallel as a direct consequence of the data locality. This
approach is very scalable and to a large degree convenient for
programmers since the programmer initially need only to write code to
process the data that is on the individual node. Unfortunately, the
physical distribution of the data is done with conventional
file-system approaches, i.e. in fixed size blocks, in the most popular
HDFS the standard is 64MB blocks. This fixed size approach means that
data that is semantically correlated is split between two storage
nodes, and to handle this scenario the programmer must then add code
to manage communication between the two nodes so that the correct
data-representation can be processed.

In BDAE we address this challenge, the talk will outline the BDAE
architecture and seek to demonstrate how easy programming new analysis
codes becomes with this setup.

#### 14:00-15:00 &nbsp; Risk Management

_<a name="ross"></a>__Automated Loan Credit Rating__ (Omri Ross, IMF)_

The current process of credit rating for a loan approval in Denmark is
manual, cumbersome and non-optimal. We would like to propose a process
allowing for a quick credit decision based on the available personal
data. Our process has two steps: First using a non-linear dimensional
reduction algorithm on the original data and then running a
classification algorithm on the results of the first step. We improve
existing results compared to the standard benchmarks.

_<a name="shturmov"></a>__The MC-squared problem__ (Oleksandr Shturmov, DIKU)_

#### 15:15-16:00 &nbsp; Miscellaneous Topics

_<a name="elsman"></a>__The HIPERFIT portfolio management prototype__ (Martin Elsman, DIKU)_

We present the HIPERFIT portfolio management prototype, which aims at
integrating various HIPERFIT research projects, such as a financial
contract modeling framework and generic parallel monte-carlo pricing.

Integration work and design has primarily been undertaken by Danil
Annenkov. Features added by BSc student projects.

_<a name="poulsen"></a>__Hedge Funds Don't Hedge - And 50-Odd Other Odd Things in Finance__ (Rolf Poulsen, IMF)_

A tour de force of things in finance that are not exactly what they
sound like. For instance: Risk-neutral pricing does not assume
risk-neutrality. The FED isn't federal. Hedge funds don't
hedge. What's up with the Mertons? Default isn't default. Change of
numeraire changes the denominator, not the numerator.

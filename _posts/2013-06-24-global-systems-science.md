Martin Elsman gave a presentation titled [Global Systems Science meets Programming Languages and Systems](pdf/elsman_GSS2.pdf) at the Global Systems Science
conference in Brussels on June 11; see the abstract for the talk below.

After returning to DIKU, Martin gave an overview presentation of [what
Global Systems Science is all about](pdf/whatis_GSS.pdf). See also the
[Global Systems Science blog](http://blog.global-systems-science.eu/)
and the [Global Systems Science Synthesis paper](http://blog.global-systems-science.eu/?p=1512).

## Global Systems Science meets Programming Languages and Systems
[Martin Elsman](http://www.elsman.com)

In this talk, we demonstrate how functional programming and
domain specific languages, in particular, can be useful for
effectively deriving performance efficient programs and systems. As an
example, we outline a system for specifying financial contracts (used
in practice by the financial industry) and demonstrate the effect of
applying programming language technology to derive tools for pricing
contracts efficiently on modern parallel hardware. We argue that
research in managing and querying big data and efficiently performing
big computations (simulations), as for instance carried out by the
HIPERFIT research center, is a central ingredient of the development
of a Global Systems Science. [PDF](pdf/elsman_GSS2.pdf).

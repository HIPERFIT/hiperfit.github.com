Welcome to a new edition of our HIPERFIT newsletter, announcing the
next seminar talks and an important new member.

Due to the public holiday tomorrow, we are again moving our seminar by
one week.

The next seminar will be on Tuesday, May 8, 3pm, in
Mødelokale A/B at DIKU, Universitetsparken 1.

We could win two external speakers who will talk to us about exciting
research topics related to HIPERFIT.

Under the title "Statically Typed Pensions", David Christiansen from
ITU will introduce us to a domain-specific language (DSL) developed in
the context of project ACTULUS. Actulus is a research project in
actuarial mathematics, involving Mogens Steffensen from IMF who is
also leading the mathematical finance research in HIPERFIT. In ongoing
work, David is developing a DSL for declaratively specifying life
insurance and pension plans, as well as probabilistic models of the
events upon which their valuation depends. He will present the
language as it currently exists with special emphasis on the type
system. The talk was originally planned for the cancelled April
seminar.

Michael Christensen from ALOC (Odense) gives the second talk of the
seminar: 

"Does your organization support evaluation and decision-making?"

We might summarise it as "Idiots vs. Game Theorists", but rather use
Michal's own words: The talk is based on a study [1] of the
organization and procedures surrounding the evaluation of credit
applications (in the order of 100 million dollars per year) in a
Danish bank. The analysis relies on a screening formalism [2], which
at the heart assumes individuals to be fallible, to examine the impact
of organizational structure on organizational performance. Recent
dynamic models explain the remarkable adaptability observed in the
data at the level of the individual. This validation of the theory
carries a promise of applicability: How do I design the optimal
organization?

There will also be the opportunity for informal chats about the 3rd
HIPERFIT workshop, which took place in Chicago on 21-23 April in
cooperation with the [Stevanovich Center for Financial
Mathematics](http://stevanovichcenter.uchicago.edu).

At the same time, the May seminar marks the debut of an important new
member of staff in HIPERFIT. We are very excited to announce that
[Martin Elsman](http://www.elsman.com) is joining the HIPERFIT team. Martin
will fill the position of the HIPERFIT center manager, which is an
associate professorship at the Department of Computer Science
(DIKU).

From April 2008 to May 2012, Martin worked as Chief System Development
Consultant and Team Leader in SimCorp, one of the HIPERFIT partners,
so he is well-known to core HIPERFIT staff. We are very happy that we
could win Martin Elsman for our academic staff at DIKU, as he can also
build on substantial previous experience in the university context: He
was associate professor at ITU before joining SimCorp, and obtained
important research results in program analysis, type systems, module
systems, as well as compilation and optimisations, in the context of
Standard ML (MLKit).

**A warm welcome to Martin Elsman!**

We are looking forward to seeing you at our May seminar.

Best regards from HIPERFIT

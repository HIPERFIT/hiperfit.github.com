## Abstract

The first two papers concern option pricing from two different
perspectives: First, we study stochastic volatility models subject to
parameter uncertainty in order to approach worst-case option prices
based on a control theoretic approach. We explore a formulation with
backward stochastic differential equations and detail several
numerical methods for their solution. In an empirical study, we then
compare the conservative model-derived prices with real market data of
European call options. In the second paper, we study the delta-hedge
for options in a setting where the hedger employs an erroneously
specified volatility. We derive results for the incurred
profit-and-loss from the hedge portfolio and explore two special
cases: hedging with option-market implied volatility and hedging in
accordance with the "true" dynamics. The theoretical implications
invite the hedger to arbitrage opportunities; we scrutinize on their
applicability in an empirical study.

The third paper considers a practical hedging situation commonly faced
by retailers in electricity markets. We look at the problem of
price-quantity risk and study static hedging strategies for
fixed-price-agreement contracts. We propose a bivariate model for this
purpose and employ risk-minimization techniques. The approach is then
empirically tested on market data from the Nordic power market and
compared to industry standards. In the forth paper we look at the
problem of optimal investment in a bond-stock-option economy driven by
a stochastic volatility model. Based on martingale methods, we derive
explicit formulas for the optimal portfolio strategy when the market
option is plain vanilla and we set the suggested plan to work in an
empirical study. In the final paper of the thesis we ask the simple
question of what is a good model of volatility. In contrast to the
usual measure of model-to-market fit for option prices, we focus on
the volatility process itself and how well stochastic volatility
models match its distributional properties. We suggest a
goodness-of-fit analysis for this purpose and perform an extensive
empirical study based on a market index and several individual stocks.

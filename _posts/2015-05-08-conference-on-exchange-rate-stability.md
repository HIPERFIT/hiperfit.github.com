On June 25, University of Copenhagen and HIPERFIT Researchers are
hosting a conference on exchange rate stability.

== Introduction

The high degree of instability and sudden movements in exchange rate
markets have highlighted their flaws and resulted in a series of
problems which range from private sector exposure to governmental
issues.  The conference will address these matters from various angles
as well as introduce the Trade-Weighted Equilibrium Exchange Rate
System from GCU. The conference is relevant for participants from the
central bank communities, governmental agencies, and the financial
sector, together with academic researchers and decision-makers within
monetary affairs.

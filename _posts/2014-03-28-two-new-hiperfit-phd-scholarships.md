<img width="200" alt="HIPERFIT logo" align="right" src="/images/hiperfit.jpg">
The HIPERFIT research center now seeks two new excellent PhD students
for working within the area of High-Performance Functional
Programming.

For information about the application procedure, and the scholarships
in general, please consult the [general
announcement](http://www.diku.dk/english/about/vacancies/phd_scholar_cs_call_spring_2014/). The
application deadline is April 22, 2014 (23:59, timezone: LINT =
UTC+14).

Below follows some more detailed information about the scholarships.

#### PhD scholarship(s) in High-Performance Functional Programming

The PhD student will be working in the Research Center for Functional
High-Performance Computing for Financial Information Technology
([www.hiperfit.dk](http://www.hiperfit.dk)). The PhD scholarship is funded by
the Danish Council for Strategic Research and will be carried out at
DIKU in formal collaboration with the Department of Mathematical
Sciences and the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen and
several finance it-partners in the Copenhagen area.

The objective of the PhD project is to develop, implement and evaluate
techniques related to executing, efficiently and safely, high-level,
functional specifications of both numeric and symbolic computations on
modern, highly parallel computational platforms such as multi- and
many-core CPUs, GPGPUs and FPGAs.

The candidate must - in addition to the qualifications listed above -
have a solid academic background in the relevant areas of computer
science, as demonstrated by academic courses and project/thesis work
related to several of the following areas: Functional programming,
programming language theory, and compilers. Experience with either
high-performance computing, mathematical finance, domain-specific
language or parallel algorithms is desirable, but not required.

The position is available from 1 July 2014 or as soon as possible
thereafter.

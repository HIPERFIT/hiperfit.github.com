This is the first HIPERFIT newsletter.

We can happily announce the initial version of our website

 [http://hiperfit.dk](http://hiperfit.dk)

The site gets in shape and is ready to provide you with information
about the research center now. We describe our research approach and
project organisation, as well as the research themes we are working
on. In the future, we are going to use it for publishing scientific
results and for announcing related events.

There is a calendar for upcoming HIPERFIT events, which we hope to
populate with related conference and workshop events, a HIPERFIT
seminar, and generally events where one can meet HIPERFIT fellows.

We will keep you posted.

In general, our project gets up to speed: Partners at DIKU and NBI
have discussed a number of potential and concrete "cases", or
"projects", as we prefer to say, with the industry partners. Work on
some of them (mainly through study projects) has started, others are
on the way.

In other news, HIPERFIT was described in "Orientering" on the Danish
Radio in mid February, including an interview with Fritz Henglein. The
accompanying text online mentions "insurance mathematics" as one
partner - almost right :-) You can find the link, together with
pointers to other articles and online material about HIPERFIT, under
"About. In the Press" -- Enjoy!

Best regards,

from HIPERFIT

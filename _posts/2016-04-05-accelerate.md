## HIPERFIT Seminar Talk

_Title:_ Accelerate

_Presenter:_ Gabriele Keller, University of New South Wales

_Time:_ Tuesday, April 5th, 2016, 15:00-16:00

_Place:_ Universitetsparken 5, Auditorium 7 (mezzanine, south end of building), University of Copenhagen.

## Abstract:

In this talk I will present an overview of the Accelerate project - a domain specific language for GPU programming embedded in Haskell - and report on ongoing work. I will also talk about the objectives of a new project supported by the Australian Research Council, to extend Accelerate with support for streams, both for single as well as multicore GPU architectures.


## Biography

Gabriele Keller is an Associate Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at UNSW Australia and a Principal Researcher at Data61 (formerly NICTA) in the Trustworthy Systems project. Her research interest are type systems, functional languages, and how these languages can be used to reduce the costs of software development, in particular in the context of high-performance computing and safety critical systems.also a Principal Researcher at Data61 (formerly NICTA) in the Trustworthy Systems project.

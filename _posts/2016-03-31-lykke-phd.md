## Abstract

The PhD thesis 'Computational Finance - on the search for performance'
consists of two papers. The first examines the performance of five
different methods for calibrating Dupire's deterministic local
volatility function, these are assessed in terms of accuracy,
smoothness, speed and robustness. The second presents four different
methods for evaluating the Greeks of an interest rate swap, these are
assessed in terms of accuracy, stability and run time.

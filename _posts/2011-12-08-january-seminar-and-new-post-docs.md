We can look back at a very successful 2nd HIPERFIT workshop last
week. A large number of participants (100 subscriptions, and some
walk-in participants) showed us that our selection of invited talks
could indeed motivate a heterogenous audience and stimulate
interdisciplinary dialog. 

To all attendants and contributors, we say thank you for coming; we
enjoyed the event very much and appreciated the inspiring
conversations.

The slides of the talks are now available at the workshop web page, so
that they can be read post-hoc.

For workshop number three, we have already arranged a cooperation with
the Stevanovich Center for Financial Mathematics in Chicago. The 3rd
HIPERFIT workshop will be a joint event, on "Functional Programming in
Quantitative Finance" (April 20-22, 2012). At the moment, the
organisers are looking for contributions (in particular, but not
limited to, implementation of quantitative algorithms, trading
applications or data analysis). Contact us if you are
interested!

But now the Christmas break is coming with rapid strides. In view of
the holiday period, we have moved our January seminar by one week. On
January 10, the seminar features two talks by faculty
members.

First, Christian Andreetta will give a talk "On Bayesian Networks". He
will introduce graphial models in general (of which Bayesian networks
are a subset), and discuss the drunken sailor problem. As this might
lead to a statistical physics angle on portfolio allocation, we have a
nice transition to the following talk.

Mogens Steffensen will give us insight about "Dynamic Portfolio
Optimisation" -- the problem of describing how changing parameters
over time affect decisions in portfolio management, and how such
effects can be modelled. Furthermore, we are happy to officially
welcome two new post-doctoral members in HIPERFIT:

- **Cosmin Oancea** joined us on November 15 as a Post-Doc. He has
  vast experience in both runtime techniques and static analysis to
  extract and optimise parallelism. Cosmin's particular field in
  HIPERFIT will be parallelisation and efficient execution.

- **Christian Andreetta** joined us on December 1st as a Post-Doc. He
  has a background in computational biology and statistical methods,
  and he is already a familiar face in our seminars. Christian will
  concentrate on DSLs for statistical and probabilistic computations.

**Welcome Cosmin and Christian!**

Best regards from HIPERFIT

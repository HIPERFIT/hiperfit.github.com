## HIPERFIT Seminar Talk: The HIPERmark Benchmark Toolkit

_Presenter:_ Thorkil Værge, MSc student, DIKU/University of Copenhagen

_Time:_ Tuesday, November 11, 2015, 15:15-16:00

_Place:_ AUD 7 (HCØ, Universitetsparken 5)

## Abstract:

In this talk, we present the HIPERmark Benchmark Toolkit, an
infrastructure for comparing and visualising performance
tradeoffs. The infrastructure can automatically run several different
benchmark implementations with different datasets and with different
compile time and runtime variables and compare the performances across
many different dimensions. Using this tool, it becomes easy, for
example, to see how the performance of an OpenMP implementation scales
as a function of the number of threads used, and also to see how this
scaling differs when computing with single precision vs. double
precision. The tool automates visualisation of the results in
user-configurable graphs. The user can also export the results and
process the data in an external program such as MatLab.

__FPGA technology for High performance computing with low latency__

Andreas Magnussen, Velocytech

15:00-16:00 February 5, 2013

The (DIKU) small auditorium at Universitetsparken 1 (UP1)

Velocytech develops IP for high speed communication and connectivity
in FPGA and ASIC. The FPGA sizes follows Mores law. The FPGA can be
used to implement high performance computation logic and high speed
and low latency communication. This opens up for a number of new
applications which require high network performance.

The presentation will give an overview of the type of problems that
can be addressed in FPGA systems today and what network and system
performance improvements that can be achieved. We will also discuss
design and test issues that relates to FPGA development.

Scientific host: Brian Vinter, HIPERFIT

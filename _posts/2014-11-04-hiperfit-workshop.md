### HIPERFIT Workshop for partners and faculty in December

On December 10, 2014, HIPERFIT is hosting a workshop for HIPERFIT
partners and faculty. At the workshop, HIPERFIT faculty and PhD
students will present the latest developments in the various HIPERFIT
project developments. The workshop also offers [HIPERFIT partners](/partners.html) the
possibility to present opportunities for involving HIPERFIT
researchers in obstacles encountered by the partners with respect to
high-performance computational problems in the finance domain. A
separate session is therefore devoted to partners for presenting such
encounters in the finance industry.

#### HIPERFIT Workshop for partners and faculty in December

On December 10, 2014, HIPERFIT is hosting a workshop for HIPERFIT
partners and faculty.

At the workshop, HIPERFIT faculty and PhD students will present the
latest developments in the various HIPERFIT project developments,
covering topics such as

  - household finance guidance
  - financial benchmarks for GPGPU compilation
  - certified contract management
  - Futhark - an array language for data-parallel execution
  - Bohrium - bridging high performance and high productivity
  - stream-based parallel computation
  - compiling APL for parallel architectures
  - online transaction processing for big data sources

The workshop also offers HIPERFIT partners the possibility to present
opportunities for involving HIPERFIT researchers in obstacles
encountered by the partners with respect to high-performance
computational problems in the finance domain. A separate session is
therefore devoted to partners for presenting such encounters in the
finance industry.

## Call for collaboration with small and medium enterprises (SMEs)

With great pleasure, we can announce today that small and medium
enterprises (SMEs) now have the opportunity to collaborate with
HIPERFIT in a special additional programme.

HIPERFIT's funding agency, the [Danish Council for Strategic Research
(DSF)](http://en.fi.dk/councils-commissions/the-danish-council-for-strategic-research),
provides additional funds to existing big research projects, with the
goal to expand ongoing research to small and medium enterprises. A
particular goal is to involve "new" companies which have not had the
opportunity for funded collaborations. HIPERFIT members have
successfully applied for these additional funds with DSF, and we are
now looking for companies interested in cooperating with
us.

The topic and focus of this cooperation is parallel quantitative
analysis of financial instruments, especially pricing and risk
analysis. A particular focus is to accelerate such computations
through using highly-parallel graphics processing units
(GPGPUs). Participating SMEs are expected to contribute knowledge and
software within quantitative analysis of financial instruments as a
prerequisite - cooperation with HIPERFIT primarily focuses on
parallelization, and to a lesser extent on the mathematical methods
used.

A more detailed description (in Danish) of the [project goals and
organisation is available
here](../pdf/HIPERFIT-SMV-Funding-201201.pdf). Please also consult the
[official call for collaboration at the Strategic Research
Council](http://www.fi.dk/nyheder/nyheder/2012/smaa-og-mellemstore-virksomheder-inviteres-til-forskningssamarbejde-under-det-strategiske-forskningsraad)
for latest information, the description of the entire programme, and
criteria for defining SMEs.

Interested SMEs are asked to contact Fritz Henglein or Rolf Poulsen,
the coordinators of this initiative within HIPERFIT, or
<info@hiperfit.dk>. The **deadline** for expressions of interest is
**March 1, 2012**.

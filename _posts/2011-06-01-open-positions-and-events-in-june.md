We can look back at a very successful workshop last Wednesday. We were
positively surprised by the number of subscriptions (62) and lucky to
arrange for a larger room than originally planned. To all attendants,
we say thank you for coming; it was a great day with inspiring
conversations.

Aside from the workshop, we also ran our first steering committee
meeting and discussed the start of our center with our funding source
DSF. We were quite satisfied with the results of both
meetings.

A number of open positions within HIPERFIT are now announced on the
university pages and on the HIPERFIT web page. We wish to employ a
total of six PhD scholars and postdoctoral researchers, and a center
manager. The latter position will be a permanent appointment with the
department of computer science DIKU as an assistant or associate
professor. If you know of interested candidates, check out the
description on the HIPERFIT website or [the DIKU web
site](http://www.offentlige-stillinger.dk/sites/cfml/kbhuni/kbhuniVis.cfm?plugin=1&amp;englishJobs=NO&amp;nJobNo=196679&amp;nLangNo=1).

Next Tuesday, it is again time for our monthly seminar. Interested
students, researchers and partner members are welcome. This time,
Sinan Gabel from Nordea will talk about "Selected concrete challenges
and ideas for further research". In the second half, we will plan and
schedule a series of overview talks about programming languages for
parallelism and concurrency.

Furthermore, HIPERFIT contributes to a workshop on domain-specific
languages (DSLs) for modeling on June 16 and 17, which is organised by
Chalmers University. World-class researchers meet and discuss how to
effectively apply DSLs and modeling techniques for societal tasks in
environment protection, climate research, and in the financial
domain. You can find details on the [DSL4EE workshop
pages](http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/cse/pmwiki.php/GSDP/DSL4EE).

Best regards from HIPERFIT

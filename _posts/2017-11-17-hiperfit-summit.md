<img alt="Workshop picture" align="right" hspace="10" width="400" src="/images/Salen.jpg">

On October 17, 2017, in the afternoon, HIPERFIT is hosting a 3 hour
summit on _Computation and Finance for the 21st Century_. This
summit will give highlights, in the form of a potpourri, of the
technical outcomes of HIPERFIT (looking backwards) followed by
presentations of insights into the needs of the future, given by a
number of prominent guests who, in one way or the other, play a role
in forming the future of the it-finance sector.

This event, together with the [technical workshop on November 16, 2017](http://hiperfit.dk/news/2017/11/16/hiperfit-workshop), marks the end of the HIPERFIT research center,
as we know it. We will, continue to operate under the name of
HIPERFIT, but funding for a number of the research projects are
ending, which, of course, opens up avenues to new opportunities.

### The Venue

[DIKU, Aud 3, HCÃ˜](http://www.diku.dk/), Universitetsparken 5, DK-2100 Copenhagen.

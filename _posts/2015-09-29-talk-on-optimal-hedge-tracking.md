## HIPERFIT Seminar Talk: Optimal Hedge Tracking Portfolios in a Limit Order Book.

_Presenter:_ Simon Ellersgaard Nielsen, PhD student, IMF/University of Copenhagen

_Time:_ Tuesday, September 29, 2015, 15:15-16:00

_Place:_ AUD 7 (HCÃ˜, Universitetsparken 5)

## Abstract:

In this paper we develop a control theoretic solution to the manner in
which a portfolio manager optimally should track a targeted delta,
given that he wishes to hedge a short position in European call
options the underlying of which is traded in a limit order
book. Specifically, we are interested in the interplay between posting
limit and market orders: when should the portfolio manager do what
(and at what price)? To this end, we set up an Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
quasi-variational inequality which we can solve numerically. Our
scheme is shown to be monotone, stable and consistent. Finally, we
provide a concrete numerical study, comparing our algorithm with more
naive approaches to delta-hedging.

Simon Ellersgaard Nielsen is a graduate student in financial
mathematics at the University of Copenhagen, working under the
supervision of Rolf Poulsen. His primary research interests lie within
optimal portfolio theory and foundational issues in asset
pricing. Besides finance, he dabbles in questions pertaining to the
fundamental nature of reality.

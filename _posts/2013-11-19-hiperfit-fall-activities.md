A series of activities are happening in the HIPERFIT research center
in the fall. Since the [PhD Workshop](/news/2013/07/31/internal-hiperfit-phd-workshop) in August, HIPERFIT researchers
have worked together with the involved partners on topics such as
contract modeling, household finance, GPGPU execution of model
calibration code, and scalable portfolio analysis. 

In September, HIPERFIT researchers were presenting two strands of work
on the 2nd ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Functional High-Performance
Computing, held in Boston, USA. The first paper, authored by Troels
Henriksen and Cosmin E. Oancea, introduced [a fusion technique for
avoiding unnecessary storage of intermediate results in array
languages](/pdf/fhpc13_troels.pdf). The second paper, authored by
Frederik M. Madsen and Andrzej Filinski, introduced [a streaming model
for nested parallelism](/pdf/fhpc13_madsen.pdf), which allows for
splitting up the processing of streams of data in a way that allows
for high utilization of parallelism. Another paper, authored by Martin
Elsman and Anders Schack-Nielsen (SimCorp), has been accepted for
publication, in January 2014, at the International Symposium on
Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages (PADLâ€™14). This papers
introduces the concept of [Typelets - A Rule-Based Evaluation Model
for Dynamic, Statically Typed User
Interfaces](/pdf/typelets_final.pdf). The papers are available from the
[HIPERFIT Publication page](/publications.html).

In December, HIPERFIT researchers and student will be going on a
retreat where they will work together on a series of topics, including
credit value adjustments, household finance, fusion for streaming, and
a backend for the HIPERFIT L language.

As a final note, we would like to point you to the event on using "F#
in Finance", which is held on November 25, 2013 and December 11, 2013
in London and New York, respectively. Please consult the web-site
[http://www.fsharpinfinance.com](http://www.fsharpinfinance.com) for
more information about the events, which demonstrate the effective use
of functional programming in the finance industry.

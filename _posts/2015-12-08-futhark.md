## HIPERFIT Seminar Talk: Status of the GPU-targeting Futhark compiler

_Presenter:_ Troels Henriksen, PhD. Student, DIKU/University of Copenhagen

_Time:_ Tuesday, December 8, 2015, 15:15-16:00

_Place:_ AUD 7 (HCÃ˜, Universitetsparken 5)

## Abstract:

Futhark is a data-parallel programming language under development at
HIPERFIT.  The language supports nested dara-parallelism and has an
optimising compiler under development.  This presentation gives a status
update on recent Futhark development, with a particular focus on
generation of efficient OpenCL GPU kernels and the steps automatically
taken by the Futhark compiler to ensure efficient memory accesses.  The
presentation will always talk about various tradeoffs during code
generation, and why it's often not a good idea to exploit all the
parallelism you have available.

## Biography

Troels Henriksen is a PhD student at DIKU and works on the
implementation and design of the HIPERFIT parallel-functional
programming language Futhark.

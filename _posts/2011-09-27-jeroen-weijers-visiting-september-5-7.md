Between September 5 and 7, 2011, we were hosting [Jeroen
Weijers](http://www-db.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/team/weijers) from
Tübingen, Germany. Jeroen, who is actually from the Netherlands, works
in the [database group of Torsten Grust](http://www-db.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de). His research includes applying functional
programming techniques and code transformations to database
queries.

Jeroen gave a short talk about ongoing research in
the HIPERFIT seminar.

_Jeroen is a research assistant and member of the Database Systems
Group at the University of Tübingen. His research focusses on
developing an efficient embedded query language for Haskell using the
Flattening Transformation. In general he is interested in functional
programming, programming language development and program
correctness._

_The Database Systems Group at the University of Tübingen (led by
Torsten Grust) performs research into the compilation, optimisation,
and evaluation of a variety of database languages, walking the fine
line between database query and programming language
technology._

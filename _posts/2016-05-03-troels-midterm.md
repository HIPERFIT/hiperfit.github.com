## HIPERFIT Seminar Talk: PhD Status Seminar for Troels Henriksen

_Presenter:_ Troels Henriksen, PhD. Student, DIKU/University of Copenhagen

_Time:_ Tuesday, May 3, 2016, 15:15-16:00

_Place:_ HCÃ˜, AUD 10, Universitetsparken 5, University of Copenhagen.

## Abstract:

I will be presenting the work I have been doing during my two years of
PhD studies at DIKU.  I will talk about:

- ...how I started my PhD work a year before I started my PhD.

- ...what happens when you apply Haskell-inspired DSL techniques to
  C++.  (The results are now hidden from the world in a DOE
  supercomputer.)

- ...how the Futhark compiler grew from a leaky toy to something that
  can actually produce decent-ish GPU code.

There will be pretty pictures.

## Biography

Troels Henriksen is a PhD student at DIKU and works on the

Do you know promising parallel functional programmers? HIPERFIT
currently seeks to employ **two PhD scholars** in the
area of parallel functional programming. 

The objective of the PhD projects is to develop, implement, and
evaluate techniques related to efficiently executing high-level,
functional specifications of both numeric and symbolic computations on
modern, highly parallel computational platforms -- such as large-scale
grids and clusters, multi- and many-core CPUs, GPGPUs, and
FPGAs. According to the overall goal of HIPERFIT, the results will be
applied in the domain of financial computations, but are expected to
be of more general interest.

Candidates are expected to have a solid academic background in
relevant areas, including several of: programming language theory and
implementation, parallel algorithms, high-performance computing, and
large-scale functional-programming. Experience in financial math or
stochastic modeling are helpful, but not essential or required. A full
description of the positions and working conditions, along with
requirements and a list of compulsory application material, can be
found [on the respective www.diku.dk
page](http://cms.ku.dk/nat-sites/diku-sites/datalogi/ominstituttet/ledige_stillinger/2_phd_scholarships_in_high-performance_functional_programming).

Applications have to be [submitted via the online
system](https://ssl1.peoplexs.com/Peoplexs22/CandidatesPortalNoLogin/ApplicationForm.cfm?PortalID=3789&amp;VacatureID=370624)
of the university of Copenhagen (please read about the required
documents before).

**The deadline is July 30, 2012**

Apart from that, we would like to wish you a good summer vacation. The
next seminar will be held in late August and announced in a separate
newsletter after the main holiday period.

Best regards from HIPERFIT

The HIPERFIT September 2012 seminar is planned for Friday, September 7
from 13:00 to 15:00 at the DIKU small auditorium (Lille Aud). The
seminar is hosted together with DIKU and consists of two
talks:

- 13:00-14:00. DBToaster: Higher-Order Delta Processing for Dynamic,
  Frequently Fresh Views. Yanif Ahmad, Johns Hopkins University, USA.

- 14:00-15:00. A Cluster of Languages for Mathematical
  Computing. Stephen M. Watt, Western University, Canada.

The talks give insights into how to query big data using small
languages and the development of programming abstractions for
mathematical programming in languages such as Maple and MathML. For
more information about the talks and the authors, please consult the

We look forward to see you at the seminar!

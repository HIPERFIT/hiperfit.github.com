Welcome to a short post-holiday newsletter, to remind you of our next
seminar sessions which were already announced in a previous
newsletter, including small changes in the schedule.

The next seminar session is already tomorrow, August 16. We are happy
to announce two contributed practicioner's talks on domain-specific
languages for financial contracts.

- Dirk Bangert (Bangert Research): "DSLs for Financial Contracts in
  Valuation and Risk Management".

- Carl Balslev Clausen (SimCorp): "XpressInstruments: a modelling
  framework for contract management and valuation".

The following seminar session has been moved away from August 29
(previously announced), to September 6, so we can include a talk by
our guest Jeroen Weijers from Tübingen, Germany. Jeroen (who is
actually from the Netherlands) works in the database group of Torsten
Grust, his research includes applying functional programming
techniques and code transformations to database queries. An abstract
and more details can soon be found in the HIPERFIT calendar.

As usual, time and location for seminars is 3:00pm in Mødelokale A+B,
DIKU. We hope to see you for both seminar sessions!

Best regards from HIPERFIT

First of all, we would like to wish you all a happy new year 2012!

Besides, this is just a quick and gentle reminder for our seminar next week:

On Tuesday, January 10, 3pm (moved by one week), the HIPERFIT seminar
in Mødelokale A/B at DIKU will feature two talks by faculty members of
HIPERFIT. Meanwhile, abstracts are available (also in the calendar),
and here they come:

- **Christian Andreetta**, new post-doctoral researcher in the DSL
    strand of HIPERFIT: _On Bayesian Networks_.

    We will give a short overview of Monte Carlo strategies,
    probability calculus and directed graphical models like Dynamic
    Bayesian Networks. Examples of applications will be the use of
    mixture models to represent financial market data, and Markov
    Fields to propose a quick and general solution to the drunken
    sailor problem.

- **Mogens Steffensen**, research area manager for the mathematical
  finance strand of HIPERFIT: _Dynamic Consumption-Investment
  Decisions_.

  We review the classical consumption-portfolio choice problem by
  Merton and discuss the complications in connection with
  generalizations like uncertain lifetime, labor income, and a
  stochastic opportunity set. We discuss the assumption of
  time-additive utility and generalizations to recursive utility. This
  is related to the notion of consistency which we review in that
  context and in the context of mean variance
  optimization.

We hope to see you in the seminar next Tuesday!

Best regards from HIPERFIT

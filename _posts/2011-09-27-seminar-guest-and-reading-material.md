It is time for another newsletter with forthcoming events.

Our monthly seminar will be held on Tuesday October 4, 3pm (in
Mødelokale A/B), featuring two talks by academic HIPERFIT
members.

Professor Brian Vinter will introduce us to Vectorisation, with
examples in NumPy (numeric Python). Brian's group is working on a
vectorising multi-platform backend for different languages. The second
talk, by Ken Friis Larsen, is entitled "What shall we do with a
drunken sailor?" Ken will present a case study of a "drunken
sailor walk".

Furthermore, we would like to announce another exciting HIPERFIT talk
by a guest of ours. From October 17 to 19, we are happy to host Kevin
Hammond, Professor of Computer Science at the University of
St.Andrews, where he leads the Functional Programming research
group. Kevin is a Haskeller of the first hour (he wrote the first
Haskell compiler), and profiscient in parallel Haskell for more than
20 years. His research interests are in cost modelling, parallelism
and real-time and embedded systems.

On October 17, 3:00pm, Kevin will give a talk on "ParaForming",
applying novel refactoring techniques in order to parallelise Haskell
programs (also including a discussion of parallel patterns and
skeletons). The talk will be held in the DIKU small auditorium (Lille
UP1). Everybody is welcome, no registration is required.

So, we hope to see you all at these talks, but we also have reading
material for you: The master students Michael Werk and Joakim
Ahnfelt-Rønne have finished and defended their thesis about "Pricing
composable contracts on the GP-GPU" last week. They did a great job
and obtained the highest grade.

**Congratulations Michael and Joakim!**

The [thesis](pdf/WerkAhnfelt_2011-10ab.pdf) is available online
from the publication page on our HIPERFIT website.

Last but not least, a paper describing our HIPERFIT research for an
audience of functional programming researchers has been accepted at
the symposium "Trends in Functional Programming". This symposium is
post-refereed and was held already in May. We are now putting together
the final version of the paper and will publish it on our publication
page very soon (so Michael and Joakim do not feel lonely).

Best regards from HIPERFIT

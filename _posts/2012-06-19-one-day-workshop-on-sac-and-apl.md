On June 28, 2012, DIKU and HIPERFIT host a one day workshop on Single
assignment C (SaC) and APL programming. Participants will have a
chance to try out both SaC and APL in practice through separate
tutorial/exercise sessions. An overall theme of the workshop is to
investigate the possibilities for using SaC as a target for realizing
a subset of APL, so as to utilize SaC's possibilities for parallel
computations on modern hardware.

For registration and a detailed program, please consult the [SaC/APL
workshop page](http://www.diku.dk/begivenheder/hiperfit_seminars/sac_and_apl).

Best regards,

Martin Elsman, Associate Professor, PhD, HIPERFIT Center Manager

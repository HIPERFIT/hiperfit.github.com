#### PhD scholarship in High-Performance Functional Programming

<img width="200" alt="HIPERFIT dinner" align="right" src="/images/hiperfit2.jpg">

The PhD student will be working in the Research Center for Functional
High-Performance Computing for Financial Information Technology
([www.hiperfit.dk](http://www.hiperfit.dk)). The PhD scholarship is
funded by the Danish Council for Strategic Research and will be
carried out at [DIKU](http://www.diku.dk) in formal collaboration with the Department of
Mathematical Sciences and the Niels Bohr Institute, University of
Copenhagen and several finance it-partners in the Copenhagen area. The
objective of the PhD project is to develop, implement and evaluate
techniques related to executing, efficiently and safely, high-level,
functional specifications of both numeric and symbolic computations on
modern, highly parallel computational platforms such as multi- and
many-core CPUs, GPGPUs and FPGAs.

The candidate must – in addition to the qualifications listed below –
have a solid academic background in the relevant areas of computer
science, as demonstrated by academic courses and project/thesis work
related to several of the following areas: Functional programming,
programming language theory, and compilers.  Experience with either
high-performance computing, mathematical finance, domain-specific
language or parallel algorithms is desirable, but not required.

The position is available from 1st November 2014 or as soon as
possible thereafter. Enquiries about the position can be made to

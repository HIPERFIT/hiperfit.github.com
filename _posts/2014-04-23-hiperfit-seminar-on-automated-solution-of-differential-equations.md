#### Talk Abstract

For more than two centuries, partial differential equations have been
an indispensable tool for scientists and engineers for modeling and
understanding a wide range of physical phenomena. The solution of a
partial differential equation is often a very challenging and
time-consuming task, involving mathematical analysis, numerical
analysis, and the development of sophisticated computer programs.

In this talk, I demonstrate how the solution process can be completely
automated, to the point where complicated systems of nonlinear partial
differential equations can be solved with ease in a web browser.

This work is a joint effort between research groups at Chalmers,
University of Chicago, University of Cambridge, KTH and Simula
Research Laboratory (in order of appearance) as part of the [FEniCS
Project](http://fenicsproject.org), a collaborative project for the
development of innovative concepts and tools for automated
computational modeling, with a particular focus on automated solution
of differential equations by finite element methods, based on domain
specific languages, code generation, and high-performance parallel
computing.

#### Bio

Anders Logg is a professor of Computational Mathematics at Chalmers
University of Technology in Gothenburg. His main research interest is
in the numerical solution of partial differential equations, in
particular adaptive finite element methods and the development of
efficient computer programs for automated multiphysics simulation. He
is one of the founders and core developers of FEniCS, an international
project for the development of free software for automated solution of
differential equations.

Right after the Easter holiday, it is time for a quick update on
HIPERFIT activities.

In particular, we would like to announce several
events.

* We are starting our monthly HIPERFIT Seminar on May 3. This
  semi-public recurring event will be held every first Tuesday of the
  month, and features talks for information interchange, reporting
  results, and generating new ideas.

* On May 5, HIPERFIT proudly presents Dave Cliff, Professor of
  Computer Science at the University of Bristol, speaking about the
  "2010 Flash Crash". No, this is _not_ the latest security
  vulnerability of Adobe''s ubiquitous multimedia plugin :-). "Flash
  Crash" refers to a sudden drop and rise of the US stock market on
  May 6 2010. Because of algorithmic high-frequency trading, the Dow
  Jones index lost around 9% - and recovered within minutes!  Dave
  Cliff will give us his view on "large-scale socio-technical systems"
  and argue that society needs "principled evaluation of systemic
  risk".

Both events are announced in our _HIPERFIT event calendar_, which you
can find on the hiperfit web site.

* Furthermore, we will hold the first HIPERFIT workshop on May 25,
  which is partially open to students and guest researchers. The
  agenda is being established at the moment; more details will follow
  as a calendar entry soon.

* Last but not least, we can already announce a joint event of
  HIPERFIT and the EU project "Global Systems Dynamics and Policy"
  [GSDP](http://www.gsdp.eu/). Chalmers University of Technology is
  holding the workshop on "Domain Specific Languages for Economical
  and Environmental Modelling"
  [DSL4EE](http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/cse/pmwiki.php/GSDP/DSL4EE)
  near Gothenburg on June 16 and 17. A selection of world-class
  researchers will speak about domain-specific language technology and
  modelling, including Fritz Henglein about "DSLs for the financial
  sector".

In other news, we are going to announce HIPERFIT open positions in
early May. These include a DIKU professorship as the HIPERFIT Center
Manager, with an interesting mix of research, administrative
management and networking. Furthermore, a total of six PhD
scholarships or post-doctoral positions in the four HIPERFIT research
areas will be offered. More details can be found soon on the HIPERFIT
web page.

Best regards

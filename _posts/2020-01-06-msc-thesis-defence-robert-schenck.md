#### Abstract

While a common staple of many modern functional programming languages,
sum types are an unusual feature in specialized, computeoriented
languages. We advocate that sum types have merit even in this
restricted setting: providing increased safety and better abstraction
at manageable cost.

This thesis explores adding sum types to Futhark—a compute-oriented,
purely functional, data-parallel array programming language. The work
includes a theoretical development of sum types in model type system
closely related to Futhark’s type system, implementation details for
adding sum types to the Futhark compiler, and an analysis of the
implementation—including suggestions to improve performance.

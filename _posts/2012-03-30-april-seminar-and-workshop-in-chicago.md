The Easter period is approaching with rapid strides now, it is time
for a quick update on HIPERFIT and upcoming
activities.

Our next seminar will be held on Tuesday, April
24, 3pm, in the usual room Mødelokale A/B at DIKU, Universitetsparken
1. We are looking forward to the following two talks:

- Martin Rehr will give us an introduction to MiG, a Grid middleware
  which can give HIPERFIT researchers access to high-performance
  hardware and shared storage, and includes virtual groups and
  collaboration software. Martin works on GPU parallelisations in
  Brian Vinter's High-Performance Systems (HPS) group in HIPERFIT, and
  holds a PhD in Computer Science from 2010 awarded for his extensions
  to MiG.

- In the other talk, David Christiansen will introduce us to a
  domain-specific language for computations in the life and pension
  business, developed in the context of project Actulus. Actulus is a
  research project in actuarial mathematics, involving Mogens
  Steffensen from IMF who is also leading the mathematical finance
  research in HIPERFIT.

Right before the seminar, from April 20 to April 22, several HIPERFIT
researchers will attend the 3rd HIPERFIT workshop, "Functional
Programming in Quantitative Finance", in Chicago. This 3rd HIPERFIT
workshop is organised in cooperation with the [Stevanowich Center for
Financial Mathematics](http://stevanovichcenter.uchicago.edu).

We are looking forward to presenting our vision of domain-specific
support for financial computation to international industry
representatives.

The [workshop information page with latest information can be found
here](http://stevanovichcenter.uchicago.edu/conferences/fp/Functional_Programming_in_Quantitative_Finance.html).

At the seminar on April 24, there will be opportunities to hear about
the event in retrospect in an informal setting.

Best regards from HIPERFIT

## HIPERFIT Seminar Talk: Automated Loan Credit Rating

_Presenter:_ Omri Ross, Post-doctorial Researcher, IMF/University of Copenhagen

_Time:_ Tuesday, January 26, 2015, 15:15-16:00

_Place:_ AUD 7 (HCÃ˜, Universitetsparken 5)

## Abstract:

The current process of credit rating for a loan approval in Denmark is
manual, cumbersome and non-optimal.  We would like to propose a
process allowing for a quick credit decision based on the available
personal data.  Our process has two steps: First using a non-linear
dimensional reduction algorithm on the original data and then running
a classification algorithm on the results of the first step.  We
improve existing results compared to the standard benchmarks.

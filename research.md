Research in HIPERFIT follows a paradigm of **project-driven research
theme exploration**.

**Projects** are concrete cases for exploration and development,
either motivated by practical needs of industry partners
(**problem-driven**), or by the intent to evaluate novel technologies
and gather know-how for later use (**technology driven**). Projects
may or may not contain information protected by industry
partners.

Experience and lessons from our work on projects directs our work on
[research themes](researchthemes.html), cross-cutting several research
areas within computing for finance, generally leading to open
publishable results. Projects help identify useful and timely goals,
while research themes provide the headroom and freedom which is
necessary for true innovation.

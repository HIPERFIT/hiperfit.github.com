Hiperfit 
--------

Today, the financial sector faces daunting computational challenges, 
involving both an increasing demand for performance and higher 
transparency requirements. In addition, time-to-market is more and 
more important for financial applications, both by commercial software
developers and in-house.
The Hiperfit[1] research center at the University of Copenhagen aims 
to solve these simultaneous challenges of high transparency, high 
computational performance and high productivity in an integrated 
approach of declarative, domain specific and high-level functional
programming languages.  Hiperfit fosters cooperation between 
researchers from three different university departments (Computer 
Science, Mathematics, and Physics), and major industrial partners. 
Researchers and practicioners contribute cutting edge knowledge from
their respective fields to bear on computational and algorithmic 
problems that transcend their own field of expertise.

2nd Hiperfit workshop, December 1st and 2nd , 2011
--------------------------------------------------
In view of our interdisciplinary spirit, Hiperfit organises biannual
workshops to encourage experts' exchange and discussions. Our 2nd 
workshop, which will take place in Copenhagen on December 1-2, features
10 invited presentations by our academic partners and invited guests, 
combined with two special talks (DIKU talk and COPLAS talk series).
Our eleven speakers are international researchers from the different 
Hiperfit areas, ranging from modern mathematical finance, via 
programming language technology and modern approaches to parallel 
programming, to high-performance systems. Interested researchers and 
practicioners of all related fields are invited to participate in this
exciting event in Copenhagen, to meet and discuss with our 
international speakers and guests.

Organisation and Venue
----------------------
The Hiperfit 2011 workshop will be held at the University of Copenhagen,
North Campus, in the HCO building - next to the Department of Com-
puter Science (DIKU). A map and travel information can be found on the
department web pages:

There will be no published proceedings, the meeting is intended to be
an interdisciplinary forum for discussion and networking. For more in-
formation, including presentation abstracts and the most recent schedule
information, please visit the workshop web pages:

Participation is free, but for organisational purposes, a workshop 
registration is required. To register, please fill out the web form 
accessible from the workshop pages.

Looking forward to seeing you in Copenhagen!

Hiperfit is the research center for Functional High-Performance 
Financial Information Technology at the University of Copenhagen, 
funded by the Danish Council for strategic research. In cooperation
with CFIR (Copenhagen Finance IT Region), the center joins researchers
in mathematical finance, programming languages, and systems, and four
major Danish banks (Danske Bank, Nordea, Jyske Bank, Nykredit) and 
two companies in Financial Software (SimCorp, Lexifi).
